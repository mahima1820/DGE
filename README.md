Differential Gene Expression Analysis is done to  identify genes which are differential in tumor vs control samples

In the above R code we have taken the log2cpm matrix as input and calculated the mean of tumor, mean control,pvalue and lof2FC 
using th for loop and plotted the volcano plot to see that the genes in our sample have diifrential genes in it or not.
